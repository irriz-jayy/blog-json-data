      "content": "So its sunday. Day two of this trial and error blog or love letter. We were at church literally the whole day. Mostly juu ya chakula but yes. And the fact that i spent it with you just makes it even more exciting. Even though tulimiss kids concert na hukuona baby wako(Natasha) uliona baby wako mwingine(J😂😂)Anyway, I had fun. A lot of fun. From the pictures..either we look too fine or we look too fine. Siri sio iPhone😂😂Anyway i had fun. I was a bit nervous at the start but things just got better. And when you told me what Harim told you if i was white id be flushed in pink. Thank God🛐😂 And when the day kept moving to the end i just didnt want it to but imeisha and thats the least favorite thing about this. Before i end this one. If I was Mwaniki and you my Didi. Id beg for a sleepover. Just to sleep with you. Its like the most romantic thing i can think of. Just laying there on each other. Just being with the one you love. Whod not want that. If i can dream of something. After having you let that be my second wish. Anyways. Im still around. Your still around. Well have more of such days. And probably even better."
