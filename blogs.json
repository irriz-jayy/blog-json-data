October 4th 2022
Today marks the first day since probably our biggest fight. I came hard and asked things in the
worst way possible. I really didnt mean for all that to unfold like that but it was alot. So today
was more of processing and understanding mostly. I woke up early enough my family and there
noises. But atleast I had a chance to talk to mum about heartbreaks. It was hard to start but after
she got it going it became easier. She said many things but one thing stood out. Something
you’ve told me before. “If its meant to be it will be.” To be honest those words were really
nice from her and from you. Im hopeful. I was scared thought to text first in the morning. So
instead i sent a snap and just kept looking at your profile to see the online tag. Then you texted
me. And that was a relieving and amazing feeling all flushed into one. I quickly answered and
you answered back. We had a conversation going at least. Im happy. We go on with our days. Its
three and I go through some of the voice notes, specifically 2nd June. And all I can do is smile. I
truly fumbled a keeper. But in all this one thing becomes clear in my mind. I have a short walk to
come to one with my thoughts and the same thing rings. Why have you never given up on
us..me? You asked me once. And i promised to stick through the highs and lows right? And it
wasnt just a promise to you. It was one to me too. So if those things really did mean something.
Then I know exactly what i have to do. Im not giving up on us…on you on me. Not today, not
tomorrow, not next week and not anywhere before forever. So if this is what i promised then this
is what ill give. Forever right?"
